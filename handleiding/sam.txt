testen of recv als firefox sluit alleen gebeurd als firefox epoll error heeft

epoll error:
client requests to close connection after finding something in cache before it receives the data from the server.
for us this causes: EPOLLER because we are trying to send data to a socket that was closed by the client. 
this also causes event EPOLLRDHUP that means the client closed the connection

need to check if post still works after disconnetion after favicon loaded from cache.

dingen die nog moeten worden geimplementeerd: upload_store, limit_except, autoindex, return (redirect)
