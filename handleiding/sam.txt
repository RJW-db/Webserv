How to Handle POST Content Types

Your server should read the Content-Type header to determine how to parse the body.

For application/x-www-form-urlencoded, parse the body as key-value pairs.

For multipart/form-data, implement multipart parsing to handle file uploads and fields.

For text/plain and others, treat the body as raw data.

For application/json, treat the body as a JSON string (parsing is optional unless required by your application logic).
